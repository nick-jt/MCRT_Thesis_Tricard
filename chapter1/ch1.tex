\chapter{Introduction} \label{chapter:Introduction}
% Combustion has long been an effective means of energy conversion. Transportation systems, building heating and cooling, and power for electrical grids are just a few examples of its many applications. Over 82\% of energy produced on earth is produced through combustion~\cite{2021BpEnergy}. 
% At the same time, the explosive nature of the process may also result in its unwanted presence (e.g. rocket explosions, forest fires, house-fires, detonative combustion).
% Combustion is therefore a process that both can be used and must be managed. 
% Meanwhile the ongoing focus to reduce global emissions also imposes restraints on combustion researchers and scientists. Pollutants such as CO${}_2$, nitrous oxides, and soot have been shown to have a negative influence on our environment.
% So while the energy storage and release mechanisms that accompany combustion prove convenient for a lot of systems, they simultaneously presents a challenge for engineers and researchers.
% The need for improvement management of thermal loads, greater interconnected transport systems, development of heat-resistant materials, and an ongoing push to reduce global emissions must be met with an enhanced understanding of these physical systems.
% This enhanced understanding requires thorough understanding of the complex fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and chemistry that accompany combustion.
% Radiation is one of the most prominent physical processes that occurs during... 

\section{Background/Motivation}
Thermal radiation in combustion systems has attracted increasing attention in recent years~\cite{Liu2020TheFlames}.
During a combustion process, high temperature chemical products such as CO$_2$, H$_2$O, CO, and particulate soot will emit radiation strongly, resulting in a significant redistribution of energy throughout the reacting flow and into the surroundings~\cite{Modest2022ChapterSystems}. In gas-turbine combustors, for example, this can result in significant changes to combustion chemistry [statistic], flow patterns [another statistic], and the overall thermodynamic cycle efficiency.

High temperature combustion product molecules CO$_2$, H$_2$O, CO, and particulate soot will emit radiation strongly, resulting in a significant redistribution of energy throughout the reacting flow and into the surroundings~\cite{Modest2022ChapterSystems}. 
For one, the increasing efficiency requirements in aeronautical combustors have resulted in gas temperatures exceeding $2100^{\circ}$C, which is higher than the melting points of the enclosing systems~\cite{Lefebvre2010GasCombustion}, and results in significant radiative heat loads amounting to up to $30$\% of the total heat flux to the combustion chamber and downstream turbine stages~\cite{Lefebvre1984FlameChambers,Flamant2019OpportunitiesCoatings}.
% For example, aeronautical engines tend to be designed to operate at higher temperatures and pressures, in order to improve the overall thermal efficiency.
% %high temperatures of combustion products may lead to high degrees of radiative emission.
% Consequently, the higher radiative loads will redistribute thermal energy throughout the combustor, and result in higher temperatures and radiative flux in the surrounding casing, changes in chemistry dynamics such as flame extinction and pollutant emissions, and, thermodynamically, a net energy loss from the system which can no longer contribute to any desired work output.
In another example, radiation from wildland fires contributes extensively to the widespread propagation and expansiveness of a flame, totaling between 10\% and 90\% of the total energy flux, depending on the flame type and intensity~\cite{Westerling2016IncreasingSpring,Valendik2008EffectEnvironment,Sacadura2005RadiativeScience}. 
The emission from the fire is known to heat nearby combustible materials, dry them substantially, and accelerate flame propagation, which may expose nearby firemen to scorching radiative loads of up to 12 kW/m$^2$~\cite{Valendik2008EffectEnvironment}.

Previous research has highlighted recurring trends regarding radiation in combustion, as discussed in reviews from Modest and Haworth~\cite{Modest2016RadiativeSystems}, Coehlo~\cite{Coelho2018RadiativeSystems}, and Liu et al.~\cite{Liu2020TheFlames}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Radiation contributes thermal energy at the same order of magnitude as convection to the boundaries of many enclosed combustion systems~\cite{Gamil2020AssessmentChamber,Johnson2021AnalysisMethod}
    \item Radiation has importance in pollutant formations (e.g. NO${}_x$ and soot)~\cite{Ihme2008ModelingFormulation,Habibi2007TurbulenceFlames}
    \item Sooting (i.e. luminous) flames have more pronounced thermal radiation characteristics~\cite{Modest2016RadiativeSystems}
\end{itemize}
Regarding modeling of radiation in combustion systems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Neglecting radiative emission results in temperature overprediction~\cite{Gamil2020AssessmentChamber}
    \item Neglecting radiative absorption results in temperature underprediction~\cite{Ren2017MonteChamber}
    \item Accounting for turbulence-radiation interaction (TRI) increases radiative emission and reduces temperatures~\cite{Coelho2018RadiativeSystems}
    \item Non-gray modeling of radiation can increase radiative re-absorption compared to gray modeling~\cite{Wu2021LimitationsFires}
\end{itemize}


%Thermal radiation is often the most dominant form of heat transfer that accompanies many combustion systems. The high temperatures from the rapid energy release combined with heavily radiating combustion products result in a 

%Therefore, 
Misrepresentation of radiation in combustion modeling can lead to significant errors in the prediction of flame properties. These errors may present themselves, for example, in $200$~K differences of peak flame temperature in gas-turbines~\cite{Gamil2020AssessmentChamber}, $50$\% under-predictions of heat loss from a piston engine~\cite{Modest2016RadiativeSystems}, or $90$\% underpredictions of heat transfer from forest fires~\cite{Valendik2008EffectEnvironment}.
The modeling procedure of radiation in a participating medium; however, is complex and computationally expensive, as emission and absorption between every point within the fluid system must be accounted for. Consequently, despite its significant role, radiation is accounted for using simplified models such as “optically thin” and “gray” models, or even neglected entirely, which may provide misleading and/or incomplete information pertaining the contribution of radiation~\cite{Liu2020TheFlames,Modest2016RadiativeSystems}. 
The objective in this thesis is to develop faster radiation modeling approaches that can accurately account for its non-linear, non-local, and coupled influences to combustion. 

%\section{Influence of radiation from combustion processes}

%Oftentimes, radiation can present a damaging effect to surrounding objects.





%These influences drive scientists and engineers to produce faster and more accurate radiation models to couple to their combustion simulations.


% Many computational models have been proposed for radiation, oftentimes accompanying Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions to model the fluid dynamics and chemistry. 
% The most accurate approach, Monte-Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT), requires a significant amount of computational resources. As a result, scientists and engineers have historically resorted to lower-fidelity radiation models at the cost of increased uncertainty.
% Over time; however, new implementations have emerged accelerating MCRT, largely driven by enhancements in computational hardware and software. 
% Scientists and engineers must continuously adapt their models to these new approaches in order to maintain the best available understanding of the influences of radiation in their studies. 




% Conversely, thermal radiation from combustion also provides meaningful contribution, oftentimes in a ways that are apparent in day to day life.
% The origins of the human usage of fire are believed to result from the radiative warmth that fire provides~\cite{Scott2018WhenDiscover,Baird2015WhenMe}.



% Thermal radiation plays an integral role in the recent advancements of combustion technologies.




% In its most ideal form, radiative emission energy takes the form of eq. \ref{eq:RadEnergy}.
% \begin{equation}
%     E_{rad}=\epsilon{}\sigma{}T^4
%     \label{eq:RadEnergy}
% \end{equation}
% Where E$_{rad}$ is the radiative emissive power in W/m$^3$, $\epsilon{}$ is the dimensionless emissivity (or emittance), $\sigma{}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant in W/m$^2$K$^4$, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. 
% The fourth power relationship of emissive power with temperature represents a significant reason why radiation is often more prominent in combustion, where temperatures can reach upwards of $2000$ K~\cite{Modest2016RadiativeSystems}.
% The high heat fluxes can influence becomes important for pollutant formation, flame speeds, and threshold phenomena (near-limits)~\cite{Modest2016RadiativeSystems,Coelho2018RadiativeSystems,Liu2020TheFlames}. Including radiation can have an effect on the fluid dynamics, turbulence, boundaries, and mixture properties of a combustion simulation.

% Many turbulent flows are modeled using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulations (LES), both of which rely on the averaging of the governing equations of combustion. This results in the need for models describing the unresolved fluctuations of radiative properties. The influence of unresolved scales on radiation is known as turbulence-radiation interaction (TRI). Emission-TRI and absorption-TRI are two radiative phenomena which can complicate radiation modeling, and have been extensively studied.


\section{Modeling challenge and approach}
The integration the coupled flow, chemistry, heat transfer within a combustion simulation are computationally prohibitive beyond laboratory-scale flames, even with modern computing resources.
%In attempt to maximize accuracy at the limitations of present resources, 
A number of models and solvers for the radiative transfer equation (RTE) have been introduced to model thermal radiation while minimizing computational burden.
Of those, many rely on complex mathematical assumptions and simplifications, such as the P-N method~\cite{Ge2015ImplementationOpenfoam,Modest2008EllipticGeometries}, which can be difficult to learn and implement. 


The Monte-Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) method stands out as the most accurate, robust, and conceptually simple of the available models~\cite{Tesse2002RadiativeApproach,Modest2013RadiativeTransfer,Coelho2018RadiativeSystems}, and is regarded by many to be the best radiation solver as computational power increases~\cite{Howell2010ThermalTransfer}.
In MCRT, random rays are initialized and are traced from their source location to other locations in the domain, with the intention of stochastically approximating transport of radiation throughout the geometry.
The resulting process can be intuitively thought of as the tracing of `photon packets' traveling through the domain.
As a result of this approach, MCRT can account for many of the same effects that electromagnetic rays undergo during their travel.

Although MCRT is often considered the most accurate, it has also been viewed traditionally as the most computationally expensive.
This additional cost results from the stochastic nature of MCRT. A large sample size of rays must be emitted and traced to obtain a statistically meaningful solution. 
Too few rays may result in excessive noise, while too many require a longer simulation runtime. In most situations, the ray-tracing procedure in particular is a bottleneck~\cite{Galtier2013IntegralAlgorithms}, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Sample_Profiling}, which presents the runtime profiling for a decoupled gray simulation of radiation in a backward-facing step combustor, as presented in section~\ref{section:BFS}.
The limitations imposed from this bottleneck significantly limit the use of MCRT in combustion simulations. So far, the MCRT methods are mostly employed in decoupled form~\cite{Modest2022ChapterMedia} where single timestep is used for analysis. 

% Recently, much effort has been put into making the computation more manageable while maintaining the benefits MCRT in coupled combustion simulations~\cite{Liu2020TheFlames,Tesse2002RadiativeApproach,Zeeb2001AnGeometries,Modest2003BackwardTransfer,Howell2010ThermalTransfer}.
% THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE I WILL ADD YOUR OWN RESULTS WITH A FIGURE AS A MOTIVATION: PROFILING ANALYSIS OF A XXX SHOWS THAT RAY TRACING TAKES XXX PERCENTAGE OF THE RUNTIME AND IS THE BOTTLENECK OF THE MCRT METHOD.

\label{fig:Sample_Profiling}
\end{figure}


Recently, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have demonstrated a significant potential to accelerate the Monte-Carlo ray tracing process~\cite{Howell2021TheTransfer,Humphrey2015ATracing} by up to three orders of magnitude~\cite{Silvestri2019ASimulation}. Speedups at this level would significantly improve the applicability of MCRT in radiation modeling. 
Meanwhile, programming models such as Kokkos, which enable the use of an interchangeable parallel back-end, allow for easier implementation and code portability on CPUs or GPUs without any changes in the coding syntax~\cite{Trott_Kokkos3_2022}.


In this thesis, we implement an accelerated implementation of MCRT that is coupled with the open-sourced CFD platform \verb|OpenFOAM|~\cite{Weller1998ATechniques}.
This implementation relies on the Kokkos programming model for parallel computing on high performance computers~\cite{Trott2021KokkosEra}.
% Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been shown to dramatically accelerate the ray-tracing procedure, a process has been done very few times, but has shown significant speedups~\cite{Silvestri2019ASimulation,Humphrey2016RadiativeRefinement,Heymann2012GPU-basedAGN}. 
Also, the solver is implemented to utilize distributed-memory computing platforms through the use of the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
And finally, as an alternative to a standard ray tracing procedure, a geometric search library named ArborX~\cite{Lebrun-Grandie2019ArborX:Library} is introduced to implement a bounding-volume hierarchy data structure with backward Monte-Carlo ray tracing (see section~\ref{section:ModelForThisStudy}). The BVH has shown great efficiency boosts for surface to surface ray tracing in the field of computer graphics~\cite{Meister2021ATracing}. The present thesis will demonstrate whether the efficient data structure can bring further speedup to the ray tracing procedure for participating media for thermal radiation.
