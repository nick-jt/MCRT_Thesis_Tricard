    % This thesis first presents a review of the fundamentals of radiation in participating media. 
    % This includes a review of the foundational governing laws such as Planck's law for a black body, Kirchhoff's law, the radiative transfer equation (RTE), and a basic description of non-gray radiation. 
    % Then, an overview of the influences of radiation in combustion systems is discussed within the context of fluid dynamics, turbulence, boundaries, and chemistry.
    
    
  \Abstract{
    Thermal radiation contributes significantly to the dynamics and heat transfer within combustion systems. Appropriately capturing its influences during the modeling procedure is essential for a comprehensive prediction of the flame.
    Monte Carlo Ray tracing (MCRT) is the most robust and accurate method of modeling radiation but is also considered to be the most computationally expensive. 
    Therefore, in order to gather the most accurate depiction of thermal radiation, enhanced mathematical techniques and computational approaches must be implemented for an efficient use of MCRT.
    Several alternatives have been introduced including backward Monte Carlo, reciprocal Monte Carlo, and null-collision Monte Carlo. Above all, the field of graphics processing has demonstrated the potential of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVHs) to the radiation modeling procedure.
    
    This thesis presents work in the development of a GPU-accelerated MCRT solver with line-by-line non-gray modeling.
    The solver is connected to the OpenFOAM open-sourced CFD platform to enable transient simulations of joint combustion-radiation calculations. Distributed-memory capabilities are enabled through the use of the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
    Parallel programming is applied using the Kokkos C++ library for an interchangeable parallel computing backend and performance-portability across CPUs and GPUs. The ArborX geometric search library is applied for a Bounding Volume Hierarchy implementation.
    
    The model is applied to four geometries of varying degrees of complexity. 
    Solver performances are presented for a 1-D plane-parallel participating medium, a 3-D backward-facing step combustor, a direct-numerical simulation of a small pool fire, and a 3-D transient simulation of a pool fire. 
    Observations are also made regarding the influences of radiation in the various configurations.
    Verifications show excellent agreement between the solvers with respect to analytical solutions and established radiation models for both 1-D and 3-D geometries with non-gray modeling. Single-timestep frozen-field analyses show GPUs accelerate MCRT up to almost $400$ times in research-relevant geometries. The Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) is shown to be less efficient in a shared-memory environment, but there remains a potential advantage for its application in distributed-memory simulations. 
    Analysis of MCRT in transient simulations showed a significant reduction in temperatures of $600$K or more compared to simulations without radiation. Loading the line-by-line database contributes significantly to the overall computational cost at each time step, and future work involves minimizing this cost while enabling asynchronization between CPUs and GPUs.%The influences of non-gray emission and absorption are deemed essential to model for an accurate description of radiation. 
    


  
    % Thermal radiation contributes significantly to the dynamics and heat transfer within combustion systems.
    % Radiation has been shown to contribute significantly to the redistribution of thermal energy from the fluid system to the walls. Non-gray radiation and soot, in particular, may influence the radiative emission and absorption characteristic in non-linear ways.
