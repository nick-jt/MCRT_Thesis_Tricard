    % This thesis first presents a review of the fundamentals of radiation in participating media. 
    % This includes a review of the foundational governing laws such as Planck's law for a black body, Kirchhoff's law, the radiative transfer equation (RTE), and a basic description of non-gray radiation. 
    % Then, an overview of the influences of radiation in combustion systems is discussed within the context of fluid dynamics, turbulence, boundaries, and chemistry.
    
    
  \Abstract{
    Thermal radiation contributes significantly to the dynamics and heat transfer within combustion systems. Appropriately capturing its influences during the modeling procedure is therefore essential for accurate prediction of the flame.
    Monte-Carlo Ray tracing (MCRT) is the most robust and accurate method of modeling radiation, but is also considered to be the most computationally expensive. 
    Therefore, in order to gather the most accurate depiction of thermal radiation, enhanced mathematical techniques and computational approaches must be implemented for an optimal and efficient implementation of MCRT.
    Several alternatives have been introduced including backwards Monte-Carlo, reciprocal Monte-Carlo, and null-collision Monte-Carlo. Above all, the introduction of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and additional computer-graphics data structures have shown the most potential for accelerating MCRT.
    
    This thesis presents work in the development of a GPU-based MCRT model with line-by-line accurate non-gray modeling and a bounding-volume hierarchy based approach for ray-tracing search in logarithmic time.
    The solver is connected to the OpenFOAM open-sourced CFD platform to enable time-accurate simulations of joint combustion-radiation calculations.
    Parallel programming is used with the Kokkos programming model for an interchangeable parallel computing backend and performance-portability. Enhanced memory management techniques are implemented to reduce overhead upon execution of the radiation solver.
    
    The model is applied to four geometries of varying degrees of practicality. 
    Solver performances are presented for a 1-D plane-parallel participating medium, a 3-D backward-facing step combustor, a 3-D time-accurate simulation of a pool fire, and a Pratt \& Whitney aeronautical combustor. 
    Observations are also made regarding the influences of radiation in the various configurations.
    Validations show excellent agreement between the solvers with respect to analytical solutions and established radiation models. Radiation is shown to have a strong increase in contribution with increasing media opacities and temperatures.
    Time-accurate simulations showed significant reduction in temperatures of $500$K or more compared to simulations without radiation. The influences of non-gray emission and absorption, as well as soot are deemed essential to model for an accurate description to radiation. 
    GPUs are shown to accelerate computation by 75\% or more, with the potential for further acceleration. The Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) is shown to be less efficient for semi-transparent media, but there remains potential for its application in distributed-memory environments 



  
    % Thermal radiation contributes significantly to the dynamics and heat transfer within combustion systems.
    % Radiation has been shown to contribute significantly to the redistribution of thermal energy from the fluid system to the walls. Non-gray radiation and soot, in particular, may influence the radiative emission and absorption characteristic in non-linear ways.
